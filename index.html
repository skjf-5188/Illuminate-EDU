                    <p>Illuminate Edu aims to create engaging, interactive learning experiences for elementary-aged students, not only to add to their education but to spark joy in the process. Our inspiration for this organization stems from our own positive experiences from similar events, where we witnessed the power of active learning firsthand. Illuminate is dedicated to bringing that same dynamic and providing exposure to new topics for younger learners.
                        We’re an independent, donation driven non-profit organization. We invest all our donations back into our projects because Illuminate believes that it’s only fair and true to our message we don’t keep any of our profits. 
                        We aim to rejuvenate creativity in education and hope you can join us in our efforts!

                    <p>On 12/14, Illuminate Edu held our first event, Santa’s Biology workshop! Overall 25 children aged 6-11 participated, and regardless of their age found value in the labs we had planned. They learned about microbiology and different parts of microorganisms by making gingerbread models, dissected and learned about the various parts of plants, explored DNA structure and functions, and observed capillary action firsthand.</p>

                <h3>Race into Engineering</h3>
                <div class="pContent" id="race">
                    <p>
                        On 3/8 Illuminate Edu held our “Race into Engineering” workshop where students explored 3 types of engineering - chemical, mechanical, and electrical through short lessons and 3 labs.

                        Through all 3 labs, they developed the engineering design process and mindset, where they first learned how to make a product and make it better through trial and error.
                        
                        In the first lab, children explored simple machines and experimental design through building a catapult! They were tasked to be creative and solve problems with the original design to see how far they could launch it. At the end, we held a competition measuring the distances!
                        
                        Next, we discussed circuits and the flow of electricity. Children made their own circuits and learned about conductors, insulators and how electricity behaves. This lab was quite a challenge, but everyone got creative!
                        
                        Lastly, we built a chemical reaction car and tested them outside! Using a simple reaction, kids saw how cars work and how chemical engineers make useful products such as food and fuel using those reactions.
                        
                        Overall we had a blast, our room was filled with laughter and learning!
